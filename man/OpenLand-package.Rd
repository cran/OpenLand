\title{OpenLand: land use and cover (LUC) time series analysis in R.}
\description{
OpenLand is an open-source R package for the analysis of land use and cover
(LUC) time series. It includes support for consistency check and loading
spatiotemporal raster data and synthesized spatial plotting. Several LUC change
(LUCC) metrics in regular or irregular time intervals can be extracted and
visualized through one- and multistep sankey and chord diagrams. A complete
intensity analysis according to \cite{(Aldwaik and Pontius, 2012)} is
implemented, including tools for the generation of standardized multilevel
output graphics.
